      <p>Flynance originated from a simple coding project to help predict the upcoming costs of my flight training. Initially, I wasn't worried about spending too much scholarship funding, but then I learned a disheartening, realistic story: another scholar in my area had run out of funding before getting his certificate because his instructor wasn't prioritizing his learning and was, rather, not teaching based on active requirements or preparing him for his checkride. He had to spend a few thousand more dollars just to get his license, all because his instructor wasn't teaching him about requirements or wasting his time and funding on "fun" useless lessons. With this newfound insight, I created Flynance to help dissipate confusion and newness to student pilots so that a story like that won't happen again. Some people's dream careers as pilots can be entirely relying on their current funding, so what happens if no one is there to help them understand the costs of training? As a result, Flynance's main goal is both to cut through the technical jargon that new student pilots can't comprehend and tell them straight-up what they need to do, and to visualize the price of flight training, helping them to decide if they can even afford it. 80% of student pilots drop out, so let's fix that.</p>
